# Git essentials - working with Git and GitHub

At ONF, [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/) are the chosen solutions for version control and developer collaboration. To help our students, this project is provided with hands-on activities for learning Git, with a focus on core version control operations and basic usage with GitHub.

The activities cover local Git basics such as repository initialization, committing changes, and branch management; then continue with GitHub and how to set up remote repositories and collaborate using these.

The activities assume you have a basic grasp of computers, file management, and using a terminal (like PowerShell, Command Prompt, Unix shell etc.), as the commands provided need to be entered and executed by yourself.
