# Git essentials - working with Git and GitHub

At ONF, Git and GitHub are the chosen solutions for version control and collaboration. To help our students, this project is provided with hands-on activities for learning Git, with a focus on core version control operations and basic usage with GitHub.

The activities cover local Git basics such as repository initialization, committing changes, and branch management; then continue with GitHub and how to set up remote repositories and collaborate using these.
