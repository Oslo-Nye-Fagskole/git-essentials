# Remote repositories with GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com) is an online platform for hosting Git repositories. It makes it easy to store your projects in the cloud, track changes across different computers, and later on collaborate with others.  

For now, our focus is on **setting up and using GitHub for ourselves**. We'll practice creating repositories, pushing changes, and managing branches remotely, for ourselves to begin with, before introducing collaboration with others.  

Now, make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) before you continue.  

## Two ways to connect with GitHub

There are two common ways to create and uase a remote repository:  

- **Clone from GitHub**: Start with a repository that already exists on GitHub and "clone it" (bring it down) to your computer.  
- **Push to GitHub**: Start with a repository on your computer and then "push" (upload) it to GitHub.

We'll practice both.

TODO - working on it!
